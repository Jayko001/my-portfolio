                        I think we all are at the phase where following through with our new year resolution is getting harder and harder every day. Now waking up at 6 every morning isn’t as exciting as it used to be in the first week. All this is okay, it is completely normal to feel this way. What is not okay is to let this feeling take control over you and your new year resolutions.

                                Getting started on something is without a doubt one of the toughest parts of anything. Be it starting your day without snoozing the alarm, deciding to go for a walk or to the gym, or talking or texting someone whom you always wanted to.
                            </p>

                                Sounds relatable right, yes it is. Everyone goes through it and you can overcome this feeling by using the 5-second rule.

                                I think that there are a lot of different variations of this rule out there, but in this post, we will talk about the idea presented by Mel Robbins in her book ‘The 5-second rule.’

                                Whenever you have an instinct to act on something, you do 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 and go! and you physically move.

                                Simple right! yes, it is that simple. Our brains are much more powerful than we think. Directly or indirectly, most of the time, our brain knows what is right and what is wrong.

                                The 5-second rule works simply because of Metacognition. Metacognition simply refers to the awareness of ones own thought processes and an understanding of the patterns behind them. Metacognition can take many forms, such as reflecting on ones own ways of thinking and knowing when and how to use particular strategies for problem solving. The 5-second rule is a tool for metacognition, in the small window where you have to take immediate action before your thoughts clutter and pull you out of doing the task.

                                Remember, you have to physically move, or else it won't take long for your brain to bring back all your fears. And once you have moved, you have now overcome that barrier of saying ‘hello’ or taking your first rep. Now it becomes much easier to follow through. If you fail to take action during this phase, your fears will take over your brain and come up with a million lame reasons as to why you shouldn’t do it.

                                Honestly, this rule has changed my life. I could gather the courage to do things that I knew I had to do but was just too afraid to do it.

                                Here is an example of how it impacted my life -
                                March 2021 - I got accepted into 7 universities in the US, but unfortunately, none of them were affordable. however, there was this one university - the University of Cincinnati that even got close to our budget.
                            </p>
                            <p className="mt-8">
                                That night, I thought maybe I’ll give it a shot and ask them anyways if they could increase my scholarship. I got the email ready, all I had to do was click the ‘send’ button. But again - my brain was quickly filled with negative thoughts like - why would the university give me an extra scholarship? What will they think about me? What if they think I cannot even afford my education (which was true at that point, but I didn't want anyone else to know it nor did I want to admit it) and a million other reasons.
                            </p>
                            <p className="mt-8">
                                And by complete coincidence, I was reading the 5-second rule book at that time and it was just then that I realized, I NEED TO USE THE RULE! This is exactly the situation Mel Robbins was talking about. And here I went 5-4-3-2-1-SEND!. The email was now sent, and there was no way I could undo it now.
                            </p>
                            <p className="mt-8">
                                Fast forward two weeks, I got an email back saying that my scholarship was increased (bringing it right inside our budget.) Fast forward another 5 months and I’m on my flight en-route to the land of opportunity - The United States.
