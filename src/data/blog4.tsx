          <p className="mt-6 text-xl leading-8">
          What if I said to you that there is a "bank" that is willing to give you an infinite amount of loan(or at least everything that they have) and that too without collateral. In return, you need to sign up on an unsaid "agreement", and the agreement is quite straightforward - "You need to use the money only for your betterment. You need to invest in yourself". And if you fail to do so, you lose the trust of the bank, and there is a good chance that you'll never get that same amount of "money".          </p>
          <div className="mt-10 max-w-2xl">
            <p>
            Do you think such a bank exists? and even if it did, would you ever think about breaking their trust? Of course no, All you need to do is invest the "money" into yourself. Simple. right? WRONG!! Even though the agreement is pretty straightforward and there are no hidden traps, far too many people fail to follow it (including me at times.).           </p>
            <p className="mt-8">
              So, what exactly is this bank? and why do soo many people fail to abide by a simple and straightforward agreement? The bank is OUR PARENTS!

            So, what exactly is this bank? and why do soo many people fail to abide by a simple and straightforward agreement? let's start by answering one question at a time.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
                The bank is OUR PARENTS! This might sound a little cliche', but let's just think about it for a second,
            </p>
            <p className="mt-8">
            Our parents work their whole lives, save money, sacrifice their dreams and everything they possibly can to make sure their kids (which is us) have a better future. Anything you ask for (provided it's reasonable enough), our parents will go out of their way to make sure that we get it. Moreover, it's not just about the financial aspect, all the love, care, empathy you get cannot be thought of in terms of monetary value. And you know what the best thing is, having someone by our side, having someone to think for our betterment at all times(sacrificing their own wishes) is an asset more valuable than anything we could ever imagine.            </p>
            <p className="mt-6">
            By now you must have an idea why soo many people we know (including ourselves at times) break that agreement. We take all these invaluable assets for granted and in many cases we misuse them.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-8">
            Here are a few examples of how "we" might misuse it:
            </p>
            <ul role="list" className="mt-8 max-w-xl space-y-8 ml-10 text-gray-600">
                <li className="flex gap-x-3">
                1. We were given the phones & laptops and the internet so that we have the tools to access all the information that humankind has ever known. And by giving us these resources, they expected us to use to find the "right" information. However, most of us now use it in a variety of different ways (I don't think I have to list out the ways as most of us are already aware of them and are probably using it ourselves.)
                </li>
                <li className="flex gap-x-3">
                2. We are given pocket money so that we can learn to manage our own finances (at a small scale), but we end up spending almost all of it to buy things to show off in a battle of "who is the most fashionable!" or "who is following the latest trend!"
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-8">
            These are just a few examples, but I and you very well know that there are a ton of other ways that "we" exploit the freedom that we get. The reason to write this post is not to expose our secrets to our parents or to make ourselves feel guilty about it.

            So let us all take a moment to acknowledge that the device you are reading this on, or the chair/bed you are sitting on, all the things you are surrounded by were given as a part of the "infinite" loan. Let us all decide that we will abide by that "agreement" and will not exploit the "infinite loan" in any way. In fact, we will use it to make ourselves a better person. We invest it in ourselves.
